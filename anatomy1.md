The **tonsils** are a set of [lymphoid](Lymphatic_system "wikilink")
organs facing into the aerodigestive tract, which is known as
[Waldeyer's tonsillar ring](Waldeyer's_tonsillar_ring "wikilink") and
consists of the [adenoid tonsil](adenoid "wikilink") (or pharyngeal
tonsil), two [tubal tonsils](tubal_tonsil "wikilink"), two [palatine
tonsils](palatine_tonsil "wikilink"), and the [lingual
tonsils](lingual_tonsil "wikilink"). These organs play an important role
in the immune system.

When used unqualified, the term most commonly refers specifically to the
palatine tonsils, which are two lymphoid organs situated at either side
of the back of the human throat. The palatine tonsils and the adenoid
tonsil are organs consisting of lymphoepithelial tissue located near the
[oropharynx](oropharynx "wikilink") and
[nasopharynx](nasopharynx "wikilink") (parts of the
[throat](throat "wikilink")).

## Structure

Humans are born with four types of tonsils: the pharyngeal tonsil, two
tubal tonsils, two palatine tonsils and the lingual tonsils.[1]

### Development

The palatine tonsils tend to reach their largest size in
[puberty](puberty "wikilink"), and they gradually undergo
[atrophy](atrophy "wikilink") thereafter. However, they are largest
relative to the diameter of the throat in young children. In adults,
each palatine tonsil normally measures up to 2.5 cm in length, 2.0 cm in
width and 1.2 cm in thickness.[2]

The adenoid grows until the age of 5, starts to shrink at the age of 7
and becomes small in adulthood.

## Function

The tonsils are immunocompetent organs that serve as the immune system's
first line of defense against ingested or inhaled foreign pathogens, and
as such frequently engorge with blood to assist in immune responses to
common illnesses such as the common cold. The tonsils have on their
surface specialized antigen capture cells called [microfold
cells](microfold_cell "wikilink") (M cells) that allow for the uptake of
antigens produced by pathogens. These M cells then alert the B cells and
T cells in the tonsil that a pathogen is present and an immune response
is stimulated.[3] B cells are activated and proliferate in areas called
germinal centers in the tonsil. These germinal centers are places where
B memory cells are created and [secretory antibody
(IgA)](Immunoglobulin_A "wikilink") is produced.

## Clinical significance

The palatine tonsils can become enlarged (adenotonsillar
[hyperplasia](hyperplasia "wikilink")) or inflamed
([tonsillitis](tonsillitis "wikilink")). The most common way to treat
tonsillitis is with [anti-inflammatory
drugs](anti-inflammatory_drugs "wikilink") such as
[ibuprofen](ibuprofen "wikilink"), or if bacterial in origin,
[antibiotics](antibiotics "wikilink"), e.g.
[amoxicillin](amoxicillin "wikilink") and
[azithromycin](azithromycin "wikilink"). Surgical removal
([tonsillectomy](tonsillectomy "wikilink")) may be advised if the
tonsils [obstruct the airway](upper_airway_obstruction "wikilink") or
interfere with swallowing, or in patients with severe or recurrent
[tonsillitis](tonsillitis "wikilink").[4] However, different mechanisms
of pathogenesis for these two subtypes of tonsillar hypertrophy have
been described,[5] and may have different responses to identical
therapeutic efforts. In older patients, asymmetric tonsils (also known
as asymmetric tonsil hypertrophy) may be an indicator of [virally
infected](Viral_infection "wikilink") tonsils, or tumors such as
[lymphoma](lymphoma "wikilink") or [squamous cell
carcinoma](squamous_cell_carcinoma "wikilink").

A [tonsillolith](tonsillolith "wikilink") (also known as a "tonsil
stone") is material that accumulates on the palatine tonsil. This can
reach the size of a [peppercorn](peppercorn "wikilink") and is white or
cream in color. The main substance is mostly
[calcium](calcium "wikilink"), but it has a strong unpleasant odor
because of [hydrogen sulfide](hydrogen_sulfide "wikilink") and [methyl
mercaptan](methyl_mercaptan "wikilink") and other chemicals.[6]

Palatine tonsil enlargement can affect speech, making it
[hypernasal](Nasal_voice "wikilink") and giving it the sound of
[velopharyngeal incompetence](velopharyngeal_incompetence "wikilink")
(when space in the mouth is not fully separated from the nose's air
space).[7] Tonsil size may have a more significant impact on upper
airway obstruction for obese children than for those of average
weight.[8]

As mucosal lymphatic tissue of the aerodigestive tract, the palatine
tonsils are viewed in some classifications as belonging to both the
[gut-associated lymphoid
tissue](gut-associated_lymphoid_tissue "wikilink") (GALT) and the
[mucosa-associated lymphoid
tissue](mucosa-associated_lymphoid_tissue "wikilink") (MALT). Other
viewpoints treat them (and the [spleen](spleen "wikilink") and thymus)
as large lymphatic organs contradistinguished from the smaller tissue
loci of GALT and MALT.
